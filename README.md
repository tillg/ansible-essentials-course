# _Ansible Essentials_ Course

Ny notes and stuff used while following the [Ansible Essentials](https://www.udemy.com/course/ansible-essentials/) course on Udemy. My setup differs a bit from the one suggested in the course as I use a docker network rather than a Vagrant one.

Github repo that contains stuff from author is [here](https://github.com/uguroktay/ansible_essentials).

## Section 1: Introduction

Should I use docker? Is there a docker-compose setup available? Vagrant is too heavy...But creating the docker env is extra work and means adding extra challenges. OK, let's do it...[here](./docker/readme.md) is the docker setup & it's explanation.

This is the lab topology my docker network needs to provide:

## Section 2: Ansible Foundations & Installation

### Commands

- `ansible --version` also shows the settings, i.e. where the config file is located etc.
- `ansible-config --view` shows the config that is valid now.
- `ansible-config dump --only-changed`
- `ansible-config --version` also shows which cfg file is used.

The `ansible.cfg` file is in `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`. It points to our hosts file in `/home/ansible/hosts`.

**Note** that both directories `/etc/ansible` and `/home/ansible` of the controller docker are mounted to local directories under `controller-mountpoints`.

**Order of config file locations** is

- `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` env variable
- `ansible.cfg` in the current dir. This is what we are using, so we need to make sure we always start ansible commends from whithin `/home/ansible`
- `~/.ansible.cfg` a hidden file in the home dir
- `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`

## Section 3: Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands

General syntax for invoking ad hoc commands:

```bash
ansible -i <inventory_file> <target_hosts> -m <module_name> -a 'arguments'
```

Ansible modules are listed [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html)(by category). Examples are

- Installing things using `yum` or `apt`
- Starting or stopping services
- Copying files
- Doing things on AWS
- ...

To start the docker compose network and run some ad hoc commands:

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up
docker exec -it controller bash

ansible all -m ping

ansible web2 -m command -a "uptime"
# same as this (because if no module is specified "command" is assumed):
ansible web2  -a "uptime"

# Get the name of our 2 web servers:
ansible web -a "uname -a"

# Copy the hosts file to tmp an both web servers:
ansible web -m copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/temp/"

# Do the same thing for servers in our lb group and our web group (":" means "or"):
ansible lb:web -m copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/temp/"

# Install the ntp package on both our web servers:
ansible web -m apt -a "name=ntp state=latest"
# ...and delete it again:
ansible web -m apt -a "name=ntp state=absent"

# See what Ubuntu versions your nodes are running (Note that we use shell instead of command):
ansible all -m shell -a "cat /etc/*release"

# Get lots of informatoion about your web1 server:
ansible web1 -m setup

# How much memory do my machines have?:
ansible all  -m setup -a "filter=ansible_memtotal_mb"
```

### Problem: SSH Connection

The controller docker at first could not ssh into the other dockers. And this is needed, even for the Ansible ping module (as the ping module creates a SSH connection - instead of actually pinging...).

**Solution**
I replaced the CentOS docker images with a Ubuntu image, as I know more about Ubuntu. Then I created Dockerfiles for the controller and for the nodes that make sure that the SSH server and all the needed packages are installed. I also created start scripts that start the SSH server with the parameters needed (i.e. root user can login via ssh).

**Careful**, I changed the password of root users to `root` to make things easier. But it's not safe! ðŸ¤ž

Helpful commands:

- See what services are running: `service --status-all`
- Check if ssh deamon is running: `service ssh status`
- Start ssh deamon: `service ssh start`
- What Linux version am I using?: `lsb_release -a`

## Section 4: Ansible Playbooks

### YAML

- Good practice: Use 2 spaces for indentation, don't use tabs.
- I use the YAML VScode extension (YAML Language Support by Red Hat)

### Tasks

- Tasks are tasks that are performed by Ansible ðŸ˜‚
- We describe tasks by _the state that should be achieved after execution_.
- In the course they mention a lot the `yum` module to install packages. Since I don't use CentOS but Ubuntu, I need to use `apt` instead. But it seems smart to use the more abstract `package` module that is available since Ansible 2. For an example see (here)[https://serverfault.com/questions/587727/how-to-unify-package-installation-tasks-in-ansible].

### Playbooks

- Playbooks are made out of plays - duuuh...

To start the docker compose network and run some ad hoc commands:

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up
docker exec -it controller bash

# Go to the dir where we have the playbook
cd /home/ansible/

# Check the syntax of the playbook
ansible-playbook playbook1.yml --syntax-check

# Do a dry run
ansible-playbook playbook1.yml --check

# If you want to read more details
ansible-playbook playbook1.yml --check -v#

#...even mnore details:
 ansible-playbook playbook1.yml -C -vv

 # Run it for real:
 ansible-playbook playbook1.yml

# Run it and see all the SSH communication:
ansible-playbook playbook1.yml -vvv
```

### Setup module / Host facts

There is a `setup` module that gathers facts about hosts. That's what ansible runs at tghe beginning of the playbooks.

Some examples:

```bash
ansible web1 -m setup -a "filter=ansible_os_family"

#Result would be (in our case, running on Ubuntu)
web1 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_os_family": "Debian"
    },
    "changed": false
}
```

Some intersting variables provided by the setup module:

![Setup module variable](ansible-facts.png)

The setup module is pre-pended to every playbook by default. It's reported as _Gathering facts_. As gathering facts might take quite some time, you can disable it for a playbook like so:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
     - name: ...
```
