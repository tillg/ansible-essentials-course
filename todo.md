# To Do / Done

My current working tasks, to do notes, log book.

* Fix that the Web servers can access the DB with php scripts.
* **Done, 20.10.2020** Getting things work: Since my setup currently doesn't work as expected, I try to fix my Apache configuration. One dsifference in my setup to the tutorial is, that I use Apache2. I therefore follow [this guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-apache#4-setting-up-the-virtualhost-configuration-file), i.e. I try to implement the steps explained here in my `web.yml` playbook.
